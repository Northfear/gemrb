Thanks to everyone that contributed their time, including:
git shortlog -s $PREVIOUS_VERSION_TAG.. gets just the committers, so
https://github.com/mntnr/name-your-contributors is preferred, eg.
../node_modules/.bin/name-your-contributors -o gemrb -a 2021-06-02 | grep -B1 name
and then prefer real names to nicks, clean up and dedupe the list, sort.
