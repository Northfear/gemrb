if ready by release, add to install targets, sample config (gametype!) and
 add instructions with a preconfigured config. Decide about including fonts.

See this checklist:
https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/issues/313

OLD NOTES
fist.itm is missing some resources like icons
dialog.tlk entries
(proper mapicon0.png)

CONSIDER REMOVING:
- the fonts, now included for easier testing (otherwise add all the needed boilerplate)
